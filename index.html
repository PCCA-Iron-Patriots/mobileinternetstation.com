            <ol>
                <li>From the Starlink Mini, you can expect speeds of around 100 megabits/second download and 20 megabits/second upload. This is enough even for an HD Zoom call while you're in the field.</li>
                <li>The Starlink Mini needs 120&deg; of open sky to be able to find the sattelites.</li>
                <li>The Starlink Mini pulls 30 watts on average, but can be as low 15 watts and as high as 60 watts.</li>
                <li>Because you're often getting less than direct sun, we recommend at least 100 watt solar panels.</li>
                <li>To make sure you have enough power for the Starlink Mini throughout the day, we recommend at least 240 watt hours (30 watts &times; 8 hour work day = 240 watt hours).</li>
                <li>Power stations are made up of many battery cells. Cheaper brands can be dangerous, as these batteries can catch on fire or explode. This also means they cannot be taken on planes (more than 160 watt hours), and they are very expensive to ship.</li>
            </ol>

                    <p class="wa-body-m">
                        <strong>You absolutely need a Starlink Mini.</strong> There's just no other option for getting reliable internet from anywhere in the world.

                    <p class="wa-body-m">
                        Buy this from SpaceX or a local vendor. In the US, you can buy this directly or buy from Target, Best Buy, or even Home Depot.

                    <p class="wa-body-m">
                        Typically, you'll want to buy the power station &amp; solar panels from the same brand, as it's the easiest way to make sure they use the same solar connector standard.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wa-body-m">
                        Also, if you can find a power station in a specific brand in your region, you're probably going to be able to find matching solar panels too.

                    <p class="wa-body-m">
                        We recommend buying a power station / solar panel combo (also referred to sometimes as a solar generator) from

                        Generally, one of these brands is usually available no matter where you live in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wa-body-m">
                        It's especially important to buy a known brand for the power station, as <strong>cheaper brands are known to explode more often</strong>.
