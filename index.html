                        <strong>You absolutely need a Starlink Mini.</strong> There's just no other option for getting reliable internet from anywhere in the world.

                        Buy this from SpaceX or a local vendor. In the US, you can buy this directly or buy from Target, Best Buy, or even Home Depot.

                    <p class="wa-body-m">
                        Typically, you'll want to buy the power station &amp; solar panels from the same brand, as it's the easiest way to make sure they use the same solar connector standard.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wa-body-m">
                        Also, if you can find a power station in a specific brand in your region, you're probably going to be able to find matching solar panels too.

                        We recommend buying a power station / solar panel combo (also referred to sometimes as a solar generator) from

                        Generally, one of these brands is usually available no matter where you live in the world.

                    <p class="wa-body-m">
                        It's especially important to buy a known brand for the power station, as <strong>cheaper brands are known to explode much more often</strong>.
